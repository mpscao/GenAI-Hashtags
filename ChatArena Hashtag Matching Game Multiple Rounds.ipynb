The cause of the nuclear disaster was the Tōhoku earthquake on March 11, 2011, the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan. The earthquake triggered a tsunami with waves up to 130 feet tall, with 45 foot tall waves causing direct damage to the nuclear power plant. The damage inflicted dramatic harm both locally and globally. \n",
    "The damage caused radioactive isotopes in reactor coolant to discharge into the sea, therefore Japanese authorities quickly implemented a 100-foot exclusion zone around the power plant. Large quantities of radioactive particles were found shortly after throughout the Pacific Ocean and reached the California coast.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exclusion zone resulted in the  displacement of approximately 156,000 people in years to follow. Independent commissions continue to recognize that affected residents are still struggling and facing grave concerns. Indeed, a WHO report predicts that infant girls exposed to the radiation are 70% more likely to develop thyroid cancer.  \n",
    "The resulting energy shortage inspired media campaigns to encourage Japanese households and businesses to cut back on electrical usage, which led to the national movement Setsuden (\"saving electricity\"). The movement caused a dramatic decrease in the country's energy consumption during the crisis and later inspired the Japanese government to pass a battery of policies focused on reducing the energy consumption of large companies and households.'''\n",
