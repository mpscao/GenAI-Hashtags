Goal of model is to identify similarities between hashtags generated by LLM Models such as Google Gemini and Llama for different "players" when given a prompt and to connect players with similar hashtags to their neighbors. 
Each "player" will have multiple rounds to generate a hashtag associated with an event and in each round, they are randomly assigned to a neighbor. If neighbors choose the same hashtag, they both get a point. "Players" can use their previous neighbor's selected hashtag to influence their decisions. Some players will also be asked to given effects and generate a tweet to describe the event. The goal is to compare how LLMs react to this event compared to humans.
