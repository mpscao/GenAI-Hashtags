Goal of model is to identify similarities between hashtags generated by Google Gemini for different "players" when given a prompt and to connect players with similar hashtags to their neighbors. 
The final code will have multiple rounds where agents will know their neighbors' selection and select hashtags based on that with the goal of putting the same hashtag as their neighbors'.
NOTE: If you are using the "free tier" of Gemini, you may get a resources exhausted error. I included a delay between API requests to attempt to alleviate the issue.
